  "quest1": "What is the difference between types of cement and concrete?",
  "answ1": "Cement and concrete types differ in their composition, properties, and intended uses. Main types of cement include: Portland Cement: The most commonly used type in many construction projects, known for its high-setting speed and durability. Blended Cement: Contains additional minerals alongside Portland cement, making it suitable for special conditions like coastal constructions because it better withstands moisture and corrosion. Special Cements: These types are used in extreme conditions such as high temperatures or freezing. Concrete types also vary based on their characteristics: Standard Concrete: Commonly used for residential buildings and small projects. High-Strength Concrete: Known for exceptional durability, used in infrastructure projects such as bridges, dams, and skyscrapers. Decorative Concrete: Used for aesthetic purposes, such as countertops and bathroom surfaces.",
  "quest2": "What is the difference between cement and concrete?",
  "answ2": "Cement and concrete are different materials. Cement is a powder that becomes slurry when mixed with water and dries during the setting process. It acts as a binder in mixtures of concrete and mortar. Concrete, on the other hand, is a mixture of cement, water, sand, and gravel used in construction. Thus, cement is one component of concrete that binds various materials and provides strength.",
  "quest3": "What types of cement/concrete does Gruberg offer?",
  "answ3": "Gruberg offers the following types of cement and concrete: Portland Cement: The most common type used in various construction projects, noted for its high-setting speed and durability. High-Strength Concrete: Known for exceptional durability, used in infrastructure projects such as bridges, dams, and skyscrapers.",
  "quest4": "What advantages does Gruberg cement/concrete offer?",
  "answ4": " Gruberg cement and concrete feature several key advantages: High Quality: Our products are manufactured according to international standards, ensuring strength and reliability. Durability: Grauberg cement and concrete are characterized by high durability and resistance to extreme climatic conditions. Eco-Friendly Materials: Our products comply with environmental standards, meaning they are safe for both the environment and the consumer. Ease of Use: Our materials mix easily, allowing for quick application and reducing time and costs during construction.",
  "quest5": "How do I choose the right cement/concrete for my project?",
  "answ5": "Choosing the appropriate cement or concrete depends on the specifics of your project: Residential Buildings: Portland cement and standard concrete are sufficient for building walls, floors, and foundations. Industrial Projects: High-strength cement and concrete are recommended for structures subjected to heavy loads, such as dams, bridges, and large-scale constructions. Decorative Projects: Decorative concrete is ideal for aesthetic surfaces, such as decorative flooring and interior or exterior decor. If you need further assistance, the Gruberg customer support team is always available for consultation.",
  "quest6": "What type of cement/concrete is best for house construction?",
  "answ6": "For house construction, Portland cement and standard concrete are recommended, as these materials provide a solid foundation and high durability. If you desire additional strength, you can opt for high-strength concrete.",
  "quest7": "How do I calculate the amount of cement/concrete I need for my project?",
  "answ7": "The amount of cement or concrete depends on the volume of your project and the proportions of the mix. Gruberg's website has an online calculator that can help you easily determine the required amount of cement and concrete. You can also consider standard formulas: for example, for 1 cubic meter of concrete, approximately 300-350 kg of cement is needed.",
  "quest8": "What should I know about mixing and using cement/concrete?",
  "answ8": "It's crucial to maintain the correct proportions when mixing cement and concrete: Mixing Proportions: Typically, a 1:2:4 ratio is used for concrete (1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 4 parts gravel). These proportions can be adjusted as needed. Mixing Time: It is important to use the material quickly after mixing, as the mix begins to set, and its usability is limited. Water Quantity: Adding too much water can decrease the strength of the concrete.",
  "quest9": "How long does it take for cement/concrete to cure?",
  "answ9": "The curing time for cement and concrete depends on environmental conditions. Generally, concrete reaches its full strength in 28 days, though initial set occurs within 24-48 hours, after which light loads can be applied. The quality of concrete improves in moist and cool conditions.",
  "quest10": "How should I store cement/concrete to maintain its quality?",
  "answ10": "Cement should be stored in a dry and cool place, protected from moisture. Containers must be well-sealed to prevent the cement from drying out and losing its properties. Concrete should be used shortly after mixing, as it cannot be stored in its mixed form.",
  "quest11": "What is the standard shelf life of cement/concrete?",
  "answ11": "The standard shelf life of cement, if stored properly, is 6-12 months. Concrete mix should be used within a few hours of preparation, as it does not have a storage capability.",
  "quest12": "How does Gruberg meet quality standards?",
  "answ12": "Gruberg holds ISO certifications, which means our products meet international quality and safety standards. Our materials undergo regular laboratory testing, ensuring high compliance with durability, strength, and moisture resistance.

      "subText": "First of all, it should be mentioned that cement and concrete are important components of construction materials, which are widely used in building roads, bridges, buildings and other infrastructural constructions. By having a factory locally, we can ensure a steady and reliable supply of the products to meet the growing demand for construction materials. This promotes urbanization and economic progress by reducing dependence on external suppliers and transportation costs. Having a local factory reduces the risks associated with disruptions in the global supply chain, such as price fluctuations, trade restrictions or natural disasters, that affect transport routes. The cement and concrete plant is important part both from the economic and industrial point of view. It should be noted that it plays a crucial role in stimulating local economy - creates employment opportunities and develops local production. With the help of the Graubergâs factory, we will be able to support the development of infrastructure projects in Georgia and contribute to the improvement of the existing quality in the market. Also, we will have the opportunity to offer customers a wide range of products, be an example of progress and become a market leader."
